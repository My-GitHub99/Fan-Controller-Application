# Fan-Controller-Application
Developed an embedded application for controlling the temperature inside a room using a Fan, LM35 sensor, LCD, and ATmega 32 microcintroller.

The microcontroller will continuously monitor the temperature and based on the temperature value, the microcontroller will drive the fan like that: 
a. If the temperature is less than 30C turn off the fan.
b. If the temperature is greater than or equal 30C turn on the fan with 25% of its maximum speed. 
c. If the temperature is greater than or equal 60C turn on the fan with 50% of its maximum speed. 
d. If the temperature is greater than or equal 90C turn on the fan with 75% of its
